Some of the RapidMiner init methods have changed.
In order to control which initializations are performed, set the following system properties 
(programatically by using System.setProperty(), or by using java -Dproperty=value)

- rapidminer.init.operators specify the main RapidMiner operator descriptor. This must be a resource, 
  i.e. it is relative to the classpath. 
- rapidminer.operators.additional to specify operator descriptor files (not resources) to be loaded.
  Multiple files can be separated by the path separator (";" or ":", depending on the OS)
- rapidminer.init.weka to specify whether Weka should be loaded.
